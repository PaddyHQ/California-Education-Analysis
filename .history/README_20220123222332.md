# California-School-Success

In our study, will be looking at the ~1027 school districts in California. We will be using two sources for our data.

* <https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory> a directory of all of the districts and schools in California with basic details about each.
  
* <https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/ceffingertipfacts.asp> this is our primary dataset. It gives relatively clean, detailed information about each district. California school systems capture robust data allowing for our data to be extracted and loaded easily.

### Model 1: Linear Regression

**Overview:**

#### Topic: Educational research

Increasing the effectiveness of our public schools has long been a strong desire for tax payers, legislators, regulators, and community stakeholders. Effectively using collected tax revenue to increase our public school performance is a strong desire of all the citizenry.

Public education reform has been the subject of ongoing legislation for decades and there's still work to do. 

As a group, we are deeply interested in what sorts of measurable data correlates with student success. If so, are any of those correlations predictive? Finally, what can we suggest in regards to re-structuring current districts or setting up successful ones in the future based on our findings.

Since per pupil spending is one of the most commonly-used indicators to analyze correlations between K-12 education spending and student learning. We began by exploring how per pupil spending in California might predict student achievement while holding constant district size and the percentage of students who qualify for free/reduced price lunch.

**Research Question:**

- What is the association between per pupil spending and achievement, holding constant district size and %FRL?
- How is per pupil spending distributed across California school districts? By region? NorCal, SoCal, CV, etc.
- Option: How can we cluster districts based on:
  - %Free and Reduced Lunch?
  - Per pupil spending?
- How do school districts break down by size? / How can we classify district size in a way that makes sense? (What is big / medium / small?)

**Variables:**

- Outcome/target:

  - Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) scores (one for ELA and one for Math)
  - Smarter Balanced Summative Assessments (SBAC) scores (for both subjects, combined)

- Predictors/features:
  - Free/reduced lunch %
  - Per pupil spending
  - District size
  - Teacher pay (average)

### Initial Findings and Free and Reduced Lunch

Although per pupil spending is an indicator of student success, a cursory look through visualizations of our data showed that other variables such as the percentage of students enrolled in "free and reduced lunch" (FRL), part of the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). The program NSLP was established under the National School Lunch Act, signed by President Harry Truman in 1946. More information on NSLP can be found [here](https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/resource-files/NSLPFactSheet.pdf). The percentage of students in a given district receiving FRL can be looked as one indicator of the socio-economic status of that district.

### Model 2: Clustering Algorithm

**Overview:**
Weâ€™d also like to create a classification system that is more substantive than the standard way of categorizing districts based on spending and family income, which is to split them into quartiles or quintiles.

**Research Question:**
How can we cluster districts based on district size and percentage FRL?

**Variables:**

- Free/reduced lunch %
- Per pupil spending

## Communication Protocols

- Primary communication on Slack group 9
- Sensitive communication on Slack private message group
- Exchanged phone numbers to be used as added layer of communication. Everyone agreed that text messaging would be an acceptable form of communication.
- Set up zoom for team meetings
- Meetings held regularly on class days, including office hours on Saturday mornings, and on agreed upon dates/times as needed.
