Analysis of data from school districts within California, identifying variables related to student success.

### Model 1: Linear Regression

**Overview:**

#### Topic: Educational research

Increasing the effectiveness of our public schools has long been a strong desire for tax payers, legislators, regulators, and community stakeholders. Effectively using collected tax revenue to increase our public school performance is a strong desire of all the citizenry. Public education reform has been the subject of ongoing legislation for decades and there's still work to do. As a group, we are deeply interested in what sorts of measurable data correlates with student success. If so, are any of those correlations predictive? Finally, what can we suggest in regards to re-structuring current districts or setting up successful ones in the future based on our findings.

Per pupil spending is one of the most commonly-used indicators to analyze correlations between K-12 education spending and student learning. We’d like to explore how per pupil spending in California might predict student achievement while holding constant district size and the percentage of students who qualify for free/reduced price lunch.

**Research Question:**

- What is the association between per pupil spending and achievement, holding constant district size and %FRL?
- How is per pupil spending distributed across California school districts? By region? NorCal, SoCal, CV, etc.
- Option: How can we cluster districts based on:
  - %Free and Reduced Lunch?
  - Per pupil spending?
- How do school districts break down by size? / How can we classify district size in a way that makes sense? (What is big / medium / small?)

**Variables:**

- Outcome/target:

  - SBAC scores (for one subject)
  - SBAC scores (for both subjects, combined)

- Predictors/features:
  - Free/reduced lunch %
  - Per pupil spending
  - District size
  - Teacher pay (average)

### Model 2: Clustering Algorithm

**Overview:**
We’d also like to create a classification system that is more substantive than the standard way of categorizing districts based on spending and family income, which is to split them into quartiles or quintiles.

**Research Question:**
How can we cluster districts based on district size and percentage FRL?

**Variables:**

- Free/reduced lunch %
- Per pupil spending

## Communication Protocols

- Primary communication on Slack group 9
- Sensitive communication on Slack private message group
- Exchanged phone numbers to be used as added layer of communication. Everyone agreed that text messaging would be an acceptable form of communication.
- Set up zoom for team meetings
- Meetings held regularly on class days, including office hours on Saturday mornings, and on agreed upon dates/times as needed.
