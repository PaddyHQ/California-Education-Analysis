# California-School-Success-Markers

Analysis of data from districts in California looking for variables related to student success

## Overview

### Topic: Educational research

Increasing the effectiveness of our public schools has long been a strong desire for tax payers, legislators, regulators, and community stakeholders. Effectively using collected tax revenue to increase our public school performance is a strong desire of all the citizenry. Public education reform has been the subject of ongoing legislation for decades and there's still work to do. As a group, we are deeply interested in what sorts of measurable data correlates with student success. If so, are any of those correlations predictive? Finally, what can we suggest in regards to re-structuring current districts or setting up successful ones in the future based on our findings.

## Source Data

In our study, will be looking at the ~1027 school districts in California. We will be using two sources for our data.

* <https://www.cde.ca.gov/schooldirectory> a directory of all of the districts and schools in California with basic details about each.
* <https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/ceffingertipfacts.asp> gives detailed information about each district.

## Research Questions

* How is per pupil spending distributed across California school districts?
By region? NorCal, SoCal, CV, etc.
* Option: How can we cluster districts based on:
  * %Free and Reduced Lunch?
  * Per pupil spending?
* What is the association between per pupil spending and achievement (SBAC math and ELA scores)?
* How do school districts break down by size? / How can we classify district size in a way that makes sense? (What is big / medium / small?)

## Communication Protocols

* Primary communication on Slack group 9
* Sensitive communication on Slack private message group
* Exchanged phone numbers to be used as added layer of communication. Everyone agreed that text messaging would be an acceptable form of communication.
* Set up zoom for team meetings
  * Meetings held regularly on class days, including office hours on Saturday mornings, and on agreed upon dates/times as needed.
